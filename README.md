# EdTech Access
Individualized educational plans access made easier. Currently the systems in place leave educational gaps where students get left behind due to the lack of awareness that certain students have educational plans as well as what acccomodations are included in those plans. This fullstack app bridges the gap and brings awareness to educational personnel so they're able to easier implement accomodations for students who have 504s & or IEPs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

Created with Vanilla JS, CSS & HTML on the front end, running on node for the backend.

## Optimizations

Currently educational plans require students to be able to ask for use of their accomodations which poses an issue since many students do not have the ability to easily notify their teachers in real time that they need to use their accomodations. This could be solved by adding a student facing profile in the app that communicates with the teacher profile in real time for the need to use their accomodations. Additonally creating more robust student profiles that integrates in real time with the teachers class roster showing which students have educational plans. 

## Lessons Learned:

Using node for persistent real time interaction and communication from client to server as well as update changes server side.

# Hello Node!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit a color name, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server. The server returns info to the page that allows it to update the display with the chosen color. üé®

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end, one to return the homepage and one to update with the submitted color. Each one sends data to a Handlebars template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.

‚Üê `src/pages/index.hbs`: This is the main page template for your site. The template receives parameters from the server script, which it includes in the page HTML. The page sends the user submitted color value in the body of a request, or as a query parameter to choose a random color.

‚Üê `src/colors.json`: A collection of CSS color names. We use this in the server script to pick a random color, and to match searches against color names.

‚Üê `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.
